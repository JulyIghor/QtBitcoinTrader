## Qt Bitcoin Trader

This software helps you to open and to cancel orders very fast with real time data monitoring.

Developed on pure Qt, uses OpenSSL, AES 256 key and secret protection.

I want to develop this Trader App so that it can be configured for any rule
and strategy. If you want to help me, then

Next ToDo:

- Make rules more advanced
